  Is there a way to do it such that the referenced assemblies get copied to the
  parent directory of the output directory instead?  For example, I want my
  plugins to copy to the the Debug\plugins folder (i.e., the output directory),
  but I want all referenced assemblies for each plugin to be copied to the
  parent directory of the output directory.
